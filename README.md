## Introduction

This application allows you to solve a puzzle of a black-and-white image. Once the puzzle is finished, the image is colorized by a Deep Learning model and appears on your screen!


## How to run the app

You don't need to run the underlying model to play with the puzzle, just run the app with Docker and have fun !

First, build the docker image by running the following command in a terminal :

```bash
docker build . -t puzzle_image
```

Then, run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 puzzle_image
```

The app runs on `http://0.0.0.0:8000/`. If this url does not work, try `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` or `http://localhost:8000/`. If the colored image doesn't load after completing the puzzle, try using another browser.

## Description of the puzzle app

On the menu page, you can choose between 2 types of puzzle : sliding puzzle and free movement puzzle.

Free movement puzzle :
- the grid is empty
- the avalaible pieces are below
- to place a piece, click first on the piece below and then on a cell
- click on a non-empty cell to remove a piece
- shuffle button will shuffle the available pieces
- when all the "picture" pieces are in the right place, all cells display their colored correspondant piece

Sliding puzzle : 
- one cell is "empty" and adjacent cells can swap position with that empty cell when clicked
- when all the "picture" pieces are in the right place, all cells display their colored correspondant piece
- a shuffle button on the right side of the puzzle ( ! some initial combinations are unsolvable ! )

Extra Features
- Add your own gray-and-white image to be colorised by our *Deep Learning Model*
- Choose your favorite image to play in a gallery of 20 images made available for you


## Scripts behind the app : organization of the repository

To develop the app, we followed several steps.
* **Scrap images** : to obtain enough images to train the model, we scrapped images on Google Image. The scripts for this part are available in the folder `scraping_images`. `scraping.py` does the scraping, and `color_to_bw.py` resizes the images and converts them to black and white. The commands to use to run them are specified at the top of each script. The images are stored in the subfolder `images`, and are in separate zip files in order to stay under the maximum file size in GitHub.
* **Train a colorization model** : we then trained a Convolutional Neural Network on the images in order to set up a model able to colorize greyscale images. The training is done in the folder `colorization_model`. The script `colorization_training.py` trains the CNN and saves the optimal parameters in `model1.pth`. `colorization_visu.py` allows to see the colorization on new images. 
*  **Develop app** : we developed the puzzle application and linked it to the trained model in order to colorize the puzzle images. The main code for the application is in `app.py`.

## Notes on running the scripts
The scripts relevant to the scraping and the training of the images don't have to run in order to run the app. Indeed, the model is already trained and does not need to be trained again. However, if you want to run these scripts, there are a few actions to take first:
* **Scraping** : a chrome webdriver is needed to run the script. To download it, see https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads.
* **Model training** : before running the script to train the model, unzip all color images (that can be found in `scraping_images/images`) into the subfolder `colorization_model/images_folder/color/color_images`.
